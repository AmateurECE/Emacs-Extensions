### Useful Scripts to Extend Emacs ###

This repository contains scripts which are used to extend the functionality of
the Emacs text editor, to provide features which aren't available in the base
package. For example, we provide an editing mode for dts (Device Tree Source)
files, as well as extend currently existing editing modes--nXML, Bash,
Fundamental, etc.

### Installing ###

Each file in this repository is standalone, and can be
installed on your system without requiring any dependencies--that is, other
than Emacs. Simply clone or curl the file, then move it into your emacs.d
directory.

```
cd ~/.emacs.d/
curl https://raw.githubusercontent.com/AmateurECE/Emacs-Extensions/master/insert-banner.el
```
